# tree-sitter-marko-js

Marko.js grammar for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter).

### Notes
Do not expect this to work in any real way. This is my first attempt at writing a tree-sitter grammar. I'm essentially trying to port the [marko-language-server's](https://github.com/marko-js/language-server) parsing logic.
